/*
cookie is a small http data that is sent with every http request.
since web is stateless, every request browser makes is independent
cookies allow to maintain state
browser sends cookie to server
and server responds with either same cookie or changed cookie

for e.g

shopping carts
logins


but nowadays sessions are used at server side.. its still using cookies but it has some security features.

security restrictions :
1. cookies are domain specific
domain1.com cannot see domain2.com cookies
we can specify which domain a cookie belongs to if using subdomains
specify url paths

the default path is the one where application resides
we can set it to the root path so it can be modified by other applications
on our server


they are set to expire on certain date and time
otherwise when we close browser they are expired

there is no possibility of deleting cookies only expiring them.

a domain can only set 20 cookies, and each one can only store about 4000 characters.


everything is handled using a single document cookie property.
