/*
an event is any user interaction with the web page.

e.g
hovering over an element
clicking an element
focusing a form field
typing a character.
submitting a form
scrolling a page.
resizing the window
closing the page


Step 1 : Event Registration

1. IDENTIFY the element.
2. Identify the action
3. Register a handler.

Step 2: Write an Event Handler
It is a function that runs as soon as an event occurs
when event handler is called it runs before browser is redirected to a new page.

event handler function is passed an event object
such as which element caused the event
Step 2: Write an Event Handler
1. a function
2. passed an event object
3. analyse the event object
4. perform relevant actions

Step 3: Perform further actions
1. disable default actions
handler function is called first, so cancel the default action

we cannot cancel every single event
common events can be cancelled

also prevent event from bubbling up to its parent node.

we can deregister it so it never runs again

any number of events can be applied to same element

register different event handlers for same element and event type



we cannot guarantee the order in which event handlers are executed.

example

element1 has child element element2
click event handler to both
if we click element2 should element1 handler also be called
this is exactly what the browser does
the event is passed ( bubbled up ) through dom tree upto the element1 , and runs any event handlers applied to parent node

in this case

element 2 event handler will run first before element 1 event handler.
we can prevent bubbling from occuring but it is quite useful

in case there are multiple child elements
we can register a single event handler on the parent element

suppose there are lot of child elements
1 child element was clicked
this will be bubbled up
and the event handler of parent element will be called
this will go to event object and detect which element called the click event.


so we have single event handler for parent element , and detected from which child element this click event was called.
