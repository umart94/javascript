	<p>More information about browser event handling:</p>
	<p>
	<!-- browser will not redirect to the page until the onclick event is finished , return false means that cancel the action that user made in alert box.
	we shouldnt use inline javascript handlers, as it becomes error prone , because this link will never redirect to this page. since we returned false here
	
	onclick="functionX(); return false;"
	
	<script src="scripts/events.js"></script>
	
	if we are loading a script file, then since this script has not yet been loaded, the function will not execute, since it does not exist yet.
