//EVERYTHING IN JAVASCRIPT IS AN Object native strings , numbers and booleans are objects ... the main difference from the rest of the languages is that there is no class keyword
/*
1. we can create class like object templates
2. we can use inheritance
3. we can create single objects without a template
4. we can extend individual objects without affecting others (objects)
5. we can extend every instance of an object
*/



//Car Object
//NumberOfWheels , ManufacturerName , Color properties that define it
//some properties are changeable such as color , Body Kits, Spoilers , Rims ,Hoods , Roof Scoops , Engine , Transmission , Suspension, Tyres , Brakes ,Turbo , NOS , Police disabling EMF :D xD
//some proerties are not changeable like car company .. such as suzuki mehran.. you cant change it again to something else like the Batmobile or lamgorghini

//Interact with car object using functions and methods
//startEngine(), runWindShieldViper()
//after the method runs there is change in car such as car moves faster and wind screen is cleaned 


//Online shop products books , dvds
//properties or variables
//book will have title , isbn , author , publisher
//properties are price ,tax rate , shouldwewrap it and give you as a gift ? , cash or credit card etc.
//displayproductsinwebpage() , addToShoppingCart()

//Object allows you to change some properties , some unchanged , other programs and objects can interact with it without knowing internal structure


var s = "muhammad umar tariq";
console.log(s.length);
console.log(s.substr(0,7)); //will output muhamma 
console.log(s.substr(0,8)); //will output muhammad

//here variable s is an object
//we define an object template
//another example
