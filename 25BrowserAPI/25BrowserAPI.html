/*
Application Programming Interface

Enables software components to communicate with each other.

e.g
adding changing or removing page elements
moving, resizing or transforming elements

manipulating forms and user input.

we can also make server requests within the page.

storing data.

new elements of html5.


Many APIs are consistent across browsers.
e.g standard html document elements and manipulating them.

APIs are usually documented by the W3C

even if browser does not support the technology, we simulate the library or functionality using javascript shims.

e.g html5 elements not supported by internet explorer.
so we create the html elements in memory using javascript shims.

localStorage API.
place in cookie or ajax calls.

//do not store the browser detected inside a variable, e.g ie, firefox, chrome
//and then run a function when it is detected.
//this is called browser sniffing.

//Browsers are identified using User Agent string, that includes OS and Rendering Engine.

//many new browsers updated, but did not update the version string. in user agent. string.

//so there are many browsers and versions.
//some browsers masquerade as others.
//some sites will block them some wont.


//rather than detecting browser version, detect the feature versions.

//httprequest api.. for ajax calls.. it is not supported by IE7 , which supports ActiveX Object.


//we use the XMLHttpRequest objects and get requests of window object. and use get requests.
