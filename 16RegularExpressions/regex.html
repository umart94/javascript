//language for describing patterns in strings
//JS supports perl compatible regular expressions (PCRE)


var regExEmailAddress = "/^[a-z0-9._%-]+@[a-z0-9.-]+\.[a-z]{2,4}$/";
//https://regex101.com/

/*
every regEx starts with forward slash ends with back slash
^ caret symbol indicates the start of regex
$ symbol indicates end

/^YOUR_PATTERN_HERE$/

means we want to match the full pattern from start to finish


anything in square brackets means that these characters are permissible.
[a-z0-9._%-]
alphabets,numbers,the individual characters . _ % - ( enclosed in square brackets)

following plus sign indicates that we can have one or more of those characters.

@ symbol is actual email character, anything that is exactly a character and not in pattern should be entered as it is.

if we do not want it to be the actual character, and included in the pattern then escape the character with a backslash.

e.g for domain we use \.[a-z]{2,4}$/

{2,4} between 2 and 4 of these characters 2,3 or 4. (com,edu,pk)

the problem is that there are longer top level domains as well
e.g 

.museum
.paris

so for every email address or website address, we first need to check whether the domain exists or not.
this can be done by :

dnsjava library.
Java : 
The name servers of a domain are stored in the NS record. If you are able to get the MX record finding the name servers is no different.

Borrowing the example given in dnsjava documentation for listing the MX records:

Record [] records = new Lookup("gmail.com", Type.NS).run();
for (int i = 0; i < records.length; i++) {
    NSRecord ns = (NSRecord) records[i];
    System.out.println("Nameserver " + ns.getTarget());
}

JavaScript : 

I know this question was asked a very long time ago, but I figured I'd offer a more recent answer.

DNS over HTTPS (DoH)
You can send DNS queries over HTTPS to DNS resolvers that support it. The standard for DOH is described in RFC 8484.

This is a similar thing to what all the other answers suggest, only that DoH is actually the DNS protocol over HTTPS. It's also a "proposed" Internet standard and it's becoming quite popular. For example, some major browsers either support it or have plans to support it (Chrome, Edge, Firefox), and Microsoft is in the process of building it into their operating system.

One of the purposes of DoH is:

allowing web applications to access DNS information via existing browser APIs in a safe way consistent with Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)

There's an open source tool made especially for doing DNS lookups from web applications called dohjs. It does DNS over HTTPS (DoH) wireformat queries as described in RFC 8484. It supports both GET and POST methods.

Full disclosure: I am a contributor to dohjs.

DNS over HTTPS JSON APIs
If you don't want to bother with DNS wireformat, both Google and Cloudflare offer JSON APIs for DNS over HTTPS.

Google's endpoint: https://dns.google/resolve?
Google's JSON API docs: https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns/docs/doh/json
Cloudflare's endpoint: https://cloudflare-dns.com/dns-query?
Cloudflare's JSON API docs: https://developers.cloudflare.com/1.1.1.1/dns-over-https/json-format/
Example Javascript code to lookup example.com with Google's JSON DOH API:

var response = await fetch('https://dns.google/resolve?name=example.com');
var json = await response.json();
console.log(json);
Examples from the RFC for DOH GET and POST with wireformat
Here are the examples the RFC gives for both GET and POST (see https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8484#section-4.1.1):

GET example:

The first example request uses GET to request "www.example.com".

:method = GET
:scheme = https
:authority = dnsserver.example.net
:path = /dns-query?dns=AAABAAABAAAAAAAAA3d3dwdleGFtcGxlA2NvbQAAAQAB
accept = application/dns-message

POST example:

The same DNS query for "www.example.com", using the POST method would be:

:method = POST
:scheme = https
:authority = dnsserver.example.net
:path = /dns-query
accept = application/dns-message
content-type = application/dns-message
content-length = 33

<33 bytes represented by the following hex encoding> 00 00 01 00 00 01 00 00 00 00 00 00 03 77 77 77 07 65 78 61 6d 70 6c 65 03 63 6f 6d 00 00 01 00 01

Other places to send DOH queries
You can find a list of some public DNS resolvers that support DNS over HTTPS in a couple places:

DNSCrypt has a long list of public DoH and DNSCrypt resolver on their Github, and a nice interactive version of the list at https://dnscrypt.info/public-servers/
Wikipedia - comparison of public recursive nameservers
List on Curl's wiki
(short) list on dnsprivacy.org
Of the above resources, I'd say that the list on Curl's wiki and the DNSCrypt list are are probably the most complete and the most frequently updated. Curl's page also includes a list of open source tools for DoH (servers, proxies, client libs, etc).


--------------------



in php there is a function checkdnsrr
if (checkdnsrr('test.nl', 'A')) // or use ANY or for other see above link
{
    echo 'Domain exists';
}
else 
{ 
    echo 'Domain does not exist'; 
} 

 <?php 

if (checkdnsrr('google.com', 'A')) // or use ANY or for other see above link
{
    echo 'Domain exists';
}
else 
{ 
    echo 'Domain does not exist'; 
}

?>
//Output = Domain exists

if (checkdnsrr('fakewebtesting.com', 'A')) // or use ANY or for other see above link
{
    echo 'Domain exists';
}
else 
{ 
    echo 'Domain does not exist'; 
}

?>
  //Output = Domain does not exists
  
  


----------------------

to just check the website url :

var request;
if(window.XMLHttpRequest)
    request = new XMLHttpRequest();
else
    request = new ActiveXObject("Microsoft.XMLHTTP");
request.open('GET', 'http://www.mozilla.org', false);
request.send(); // there will be a 'pause' here until the response to come.
// the object request will be actually modified
if (request.status === 404) {
    alert("The page you are trying to reach is not available.");
}




jQuery :

I found this worked in my scenario.

The jqXHR.success(), jqXHR.error(), and jqXHR.complete() callback methods introduced in jQuery 1.5 are deprecated as of jQuery 1.8. To prepare your code for their eventual removal, use jqXHR.done(), jqXHR.fail(), and jqXHR.always() instead.

$.get("urlToCheck.com").done(function () {
  alert("success");
}).fail(function () {
   alert("failed.");
});
